# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application by taking inspiration from the same kind of project of shivam. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://shiv.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A* Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
